# Game-of-Thornes
A single player brainstorming game

Story and rules :

House Lannister took the Iron Throne by slaughtering Mad King of House Targaryen. Now its upto
Daenerys Targaryen, daughter of Mad King, to reclaim her father's throne.

To do it she has to defeat three houses(House Lannister,House Baratheon, House Greyjoy). In the way she will have to fight Black Kinghts (black) and
Lannister soliders (red). She will have some initial power. If she has more power than Black Kinght,
Black Kinght will be defeated and her power will be increased by their power. In case of Lannister
soliders, if she has more power than them, they will be defeated and her power will be decreased by
their power. There may be some tent on the way, inside the tent there may be a red or black solider.
While fighting her opponent if her power becomes zero she will die and fail to reclaim her fathers
throne. But if she can defeat all three houses she will be successful to reclaim her father's throne.
